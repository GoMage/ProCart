## ⚠️ Important Notice: Magento 1 Support Has Ended

Dear Users,

We want to remind you that **official support for Magento 1 ended on June 30, 2020**, as announced by [Adobe](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-1-end-of-life.html). Since that date, **Magento 1 is considered deprecated**, and no further security updates, patches, or technical support are provided by Adobe.

### What This Means for Our Extensions

- All our Magento 1 extensions are **no longer maintained or supported**.
- We cannot guarantee compatibility, performance, or security on M1-based systems.
- Any issues encountered on Magento 1 installations fall outside our current support scope.

### What You Can Do

If you are still using Magento 1, we **strongly recommend migrating to Magento 2** or another supported platform to ensure your store's stability, performance, and security.

We understand that some clients may continue to use Magento 1 at their own risk. While we may be able to review issues as a courtesy (upon access to your environment), we do **not assume responsibility** for problems related to a system that is officially obsolete.

Thank you for your understanding.
